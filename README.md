# design.oxide.computer

We are looking for designers who code to help build a new user experience for computing!

Interested? Send a PR with any improvement to this repo on GitHub or [apply through our careers page](https://oxide.computer/careers/product-engineering/).

## Contributing

### Running locally

Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Run `hugo serve` to automatically update as you make changes. This will output
the url to the browser.

Or you can use `make serve`.

### Deploying

The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so we get
[previews of changes in PRs](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/).

## Prior Art

This idea was based off something a team at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/join-dev-design/) did as well :)

The circuit animation is forked from [codepen](https://codepen.io/christopherprins/pen/rZZWoj).
